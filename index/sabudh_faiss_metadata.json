She has a positive Homans sign and a positive Babinski's reflex. Arrange a room.” As this type of drama plays out every day in hospitals and clinics, eliciting a thorough history and performing a careful examination continue to be the cornerstones of clinical practice. Despite marked improvements in technology, the patient assessment is based on both subtle history clues and an observant exam. This still yields the highest diagnostic results, not to mention the cost-benefit ratio and the rapport it establishes with the patient. Those clues should always direct the technology, not the other way around. Handbook of Signs & Symptoms, Fifth Edition, is a treasure trove of prompts and reminders for the clinician.

    "text": "A Abdominal Distention (See Also Abdominal Mass, Abdominal Pain, Abdominal Rigidity) Abdominal distention refers to increased abdominal girth — the result of increased intra- abdominal pressure forcing the abdominal wall outward. Distention may be mild or severe, depending on the amount of pressure. It may be localized or diffuse and may occur gradually or suddenly. Acute abdominal distention may signal life-threatening peritonitis or acute bowel obstruction. Abdominal distention may result from fat, flatus, a fetus (pregnancy or intra-abdominal mass [ectopic pregnancy]), or fluid. Fluid and gas are normally present in the GI tract but not in the peritoneal cavity. However, if fluid and gas can’t pass freely through the GI tract, abdominal distention occurs. In the peritoneal cavity, distention may reflect acute bleeding, accumulation of ascitic fluid, or air from perforation of an abdominal organ. Abdominal distention doesn’t always signal pathology. For example, in anxious patients o"

For example, in anxious patients or those with digestive distress, localized distention in the left upper quadrant can result from aerophagia — the unconscious swallowing of air. Generalized distention can result from ingestion of fruits or vegetables with large quantities of unabsorbable carbohydrates, such as legumes, or from abnormal food fermentation by microbes. Don’t forget to rule out pregnancy in all females with abdominal distention. EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS If the patient displays abdominal distention, quickly check for signs of hypovolemia, such as pallor, diaphoresis, hypotension, a rapid thready pulse, rapid shallow breathing, decreased urine output, and altered mentation.

Find out about any recent accidents, and observe him for signs of trauma and peritoneal bleeding, such as Cullen’s sign or Turner’s sign. Then, auscultate all abdominal quadrants, noting rapid and high-pitched, diminished, or absent bowel sounds. (If you don’t hear bowel sounds immediately, listen for at least 5 minutes in each of the four abdominal quadrants.) Gently palpate the abdomen for rigidity. Remember that deep or extensive palpation may increase pain. If you detect abdominal distention and rigidity along with abnormal bowel sounds and if the patient complains of pain, begin emergency interventions. Place the patient in the supine position, administer oxygen, and insert an I.V. line for fluid replacement. Prepare to insert a nasogastric tube to relieve acute intraluminal distention.

Also, note chronic constipation. Has the patient recently had abdominal surgery, which can lead to abdominal distention? Ask about recent accidents, even minor ones, such as falling off a stepladder.

An inverted umbilicus may indicate distention from gas; it’s also common in obesity. Inspect the abdomen for signs of inguinal or femoral hernia and for incisions that may point to adhesions. Both may lead to intestinal obstruction. Then, auscultate for bowel sounds, abdominal friction rubs (indicating peritoneal inflammation), and bruits (indicating an aneurysm).

EXAMINATION TIP Detecting Ascites To differentiate ascites from other causes of abdominal distention, check for shifting dullness, fluid wave, and puddle sign, as described here. SHIFTING DULLNESS Step 1. With the patient in a supine position, percuss from the umbilicus outward to the flank, as shown. Draw a line on the patient’s skin to mark the change from tympany to dullness. Step 2. Turn the patient onto his side. (Note that this positioning causes ascitic fluid to shift.) Percuss again, and mark the change from tympany to dullness. A difference between these lines can indicate ascites. FLUID WAVE Have another person press deeply into the patient’s midline to prevent vibration from traveling along the abdominal wall. Place one of your palms on one of the patient’s flanks. Strike the opposite flank with your other hand. If you feel the blow in the opposite palm, ascitic fluid is present."

The percussion note becomes louder at the edge of the puddle, or the ascitic pool. Next, percuss and palpate the abdomen to determine if distention results from air, fluid, or both. A tympanic note in the left lower quadrant suggests an air-filled descending or sigmoid colon. A tympanic note throughout a generally distended abdomen suggests an air-filled peritoneal cavity. A dull percussion note throughout a generally distended abdomen suggests a fluid-filled peritoneal cavity. Shifting of dullness laterally with the patient in the decubitus position also indicates a fluid- filled abdominal cavity. A pelvic or intra-abdominal mass causes local dullness upon percussion and should be palpable. Obesity causes a large abdomen without shifting dullness, prominent tympany, or palpable bowel or other masses,"

You can gather clues by observing the child while he’s coughing, walking, or even climbing on office furniture. Remove all the child’s clothing to avoid missing diagnostic clues. Also, perform a gentle rectal examination. In neonates, ascites usually result from GI or urinary perforation; in older children, from heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis. Besides ascites, congenital malformations of the GI tract (such as intussusception and volvulus) may cause abdominal distention.

However, these tips will make palpation easier for you: Allow an infant to suck on his bottle or pacifier to prevent crying, which causes abdominal rigidity and interferes with palpation. Avoid tickling him because laughter also causes abdominal rigidity. Also, reduce his apprehension by distracting him with cheerful conversation. Rest your hand on his abdomen for a few moments before palpation. If he remains sensitive, place his hand under yours as you palpate. Consider allowing the child to remain on the parent’s or caregiver’s lap. A gentle rectal examination should also be performed. In neonates, most abdominal masses result from renal disorders, such as polycystic kidney disease or congenital hydronephrosis.

Voluntary rigidity reflects the patient’s fear or nervousness upon palpation; involuntary rigidity reflects potentially life-threatening peritoneal irritation or inflammation.

However, more pronounced use of these muscles may signal acute respiratory distress, diaphragmatic weakness, or fatigue. It may also result from chronic respiratory disease. Typically, the extent of accessory muscle use reflects the severity of the underlying cause. EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS If the patient displays increased accessory muscle use, immediately look for signs of acute respiratory distress. These include a decreased level of consciousness, shortness of breath when speaking, tachypnea, intercostal and sternal retractions, cyanosis, adventitious breath sounds (such as wheezing or stridor), diaphoresis, nasal flaring, and extreme apprehension or agitation. Quickly auscultate for abnormal, diminished, or absent breath sounds. Check for airway obstruction, and, if detected, attempt to restore airway patency. Insert an airway, or intubate the patient.

You may need to use a high flow rate initially, but be attentive to the patient’s respiratory drive. Giving a patient with COPD too much oxygen may decrease his respiratory drive. An I.V. line may be required. History and Physical Examination If the patient’s condition allows, examine him more closely.

When this happens, accessory muscles provide the extra effort needed to maintain respirations. The upper accessory muscles assist with inspiration, whereas the upper chest, sternum, internal intercostal, and abdominal muscles assist with expiration. With inspiration, the scalene muscles elevate, fix, and expand the upper chest. The sternocleidomastoid muscles raise the sternum, expanding the chest’s anteroposterior and longitudinal dimensions. The pectoralis major elevates the chest, increasing its anteroposterior size, and the trapezius raises the thoracic cage. With expiration, the internal intercostals depress the ribs, decreasing the chest size. The abdominal muscles pull the lower chest down, depress the lower ribs, and compress the abdominal contents, which exerts pressure on the chest. Ask about recent t"

Is the anxiety constant or sporadic? Did he notice precipitating factors? Find out if the anxiety is exacerbated by stress, lack of sleep, or caffeine intake and alleviated by rest, tranquilizers, or exercise. Obtain a complete medical history, especially noting drug use. Then, perform a physical examination, focusing on any complaints that may trigger or be aggravated by anxiety. If the patient’s anxiety isn’t accompanied by significant physical signs, suspect a psychological basis. Determine the patient’s level of consciousness (LOC), and observe his behavior.

Most children recover from RSV infection within 8 to 15 days without sequelae. Premature infants and those with underlying respiratory, cardiac, neuromuscular, and immunological conditions require special co"

Central nervous system (CNS) depressants may cause hypoventilation and apnea. Benzodiazepines may cause respiratory depression and apnea when given I.V. along with other CNS depressants to elderly or acutely ill patients. Neuromuscular blockers — such as curariform drugs and anticholinesterases — may produce sudden apnea because of respiratory muscle paralysis. Sleep-related apneas.

Other common causes include sepsis, intraventricular and subarachnoid hemorrhage, seizures, bronchiolitis, RSV, and sudden infant death syndrome. In toddlers and older children, the primary cause of apnea is acute airway obstruction from aspiration of foreign objects.

Involuntary breathing is primarily regulated by groups of neurons located in respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata and pons. In the medulla, neurons react to impulses from the pons and other areas to regulate respiratory rate and depth. In the pons, two respiratory centers regulate respiratory rhythm by interacting with the medullary respiratory center to smooth the transition from inspiration to expiration and back. The apneustic center in the pons stimulates inspiratory neurons in the medulla to precipitate inspiration. These inspiratory neurons, in turn, stimulate the pneumotaxic center in the pons to precipitate expiration.

GAIT ATAXIA With gait ataxia, the patient’s gait is wide based, unsteady, and irregular. LIMB ATAXIA With limb ataxia, the patient loses the ability to gauge distance, speed, and power of movement, resulting in poorly controlled, variable, and inaccurate voluntary movements. He may move too quickly or too slowly, or his movements may break down into component parts, giving him the appearance of a puppet or a robot. Other effects include a coarse, irregular tremor in purposeful movement (but not at rest) and reduced muscle tone. SENSORY ATAXIA With sensory ataxia, the patient moves abruptly and stomps or taps his feet. This occurs because he throws his feet forward and outward and then brings them down first on the heels and then on the toes. The patient also fixes his eyes on the ground, watching his steps.

SPEECH ATAXIA Speech ataxia is a form of dysarthria in which the patient typically speaks slowly and stresses usually unstressed words and syllables. Speech content is unaffected. TRUNCAL ATAXIA Truncal ataxia is a disturbance in equilibrium in which the patient can’t sit or stand without falling. Also, his head and trunk may bob and sway (titubation). If he can walk, his gait is reeling. Ataxia may be observed in the patient’s speech, in the movements of his trunk and limbs, or in his gait.

Aura An aura is a sensory or motor phenomenon, idea, or emotion that marks the initial stage of a seizure or the approach of a classic migraine headache. Auras may be classified as cognitive, affective, psychosensory, or psychomotor. (See Recognizing Types of Auras.) When associated with a seizure, an aura stems from an irritable focus in the brain that spreads throughout the cortex. Although an aura was once considered a sign of impending seizure, it’s now considered the first stage of a seizure. Typically, it occurs seconds to minutes before the ictal phase. Its intensity, duration, and type depend on the origin of the irritable focus. For example, an aura of bitter taste commonly accompanies a frontal lobe lesion.

Although the disease most commonly occurs in wild and domestic grazing animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, the spores can live in the soil for many years. The disease can occur in humans exposed to infected animals, tissue from infected animals, or biological warfare. Most natural cases occur in agricultural regions worldwide. Anthrax may occur in the cutaneous, inhalation, or GI form. Inhalation anthrax is caused by inhalation of aerosolized spores. Initial signs and symptoms are flulike and include fever, chills, weakness, cough, and chest pain. The disease generally occurs in two stages with a period of recovery after the initial signs and symptoms. The second stage develops abruptly with rapid deterioration marked by fever, dyspnea, stridor, and hypotension, generally leading to death within 24 hours.

A brief review of its regulating mechanisms — nervous system control, capillary fluid shifts, kidney excretion, and hormonal changes — will help you understand how elevated blood pressure develops. Nervous system control involves the sympathetic system, chiefly baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, which promotes moderate vasoconstriction to maintain normal blood pressure. When this system responds inappropriately, increased vasoconstriction enhances peripheral resistance, resulting in elevated blood pressure. Capillary fluid shifts regulate blood volume by responding to arterial pressure. Increased pressure forces fluid into the interstitial space; decreased pressure allows it to be drawn back into the arteries by osmosis. However, this fluid shift may take several hours to adjust blood pressure. Kidney excretion also helps regulate blood volume by increasing or decreasing urine formation.

Normally, an arterial pressure of about 60 mm Hg maintains urine output. When pressure drops below this reading, urine formation ceases, thereby increasing blood volume. Conversely, when arterial pressure exceeds this reading, urine formation increases, thereby reducing blood volume. Like capillary fluid shifts, this mechanism may take several hours to adjust blood pressure. Hormonal changes reflect stimulation of the kidney’s renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in response to low arterial pressure. This system affects vasoconstriction, which increases arterial pressure, and stimulates aldosterone release, which regulates sodium retention — a key determinant of blood volume."

Bowel Sounds, Absent[Silent abdomen] Absent bowel sounds refers to an inability to hear any bowel sounds with a stethoscope in any quadrant after listening for at least 5 minutes. Bowel sounds cease when mechanical or vascular obstruction or neurogenic inhibition halts peristalsis.

Vascular obstruction cuts off circulation to the intestinal walls, leading to ischemia, necrosis, and shock.

It may also follow mechanical or vascular obstruction or metabolic derangement such as hypokalemia. Abrupt cessation of bowel sounds, when accompanied by abdominal pain, rigidity, and distention, signals a life-threatening crisis requiring immediate intervention.

Before concluding that the patient has absent bowel sounds, ask yourself these three questions: Did you use the diaphragm of your stethoscope to auscultate for the bowel sounds? The diaphragm detects high-frequency sounds, such as bowel sounds, whereas the bell detects low-frequency sounds, such as a vascular bruit or venous hum. Did you listen in the same spot for at least 5 minutes for the presence of bowel sounds? Normally, bowel sounds occur every 5 to 15 seconds, but the duration of a single sound may be less than 1 second. Did you listen for bowel sounds in all quadrants? Bowel sounds may be absent in one quadrant but present in another. Ask about conditions that commonly lead to mechanical obstruction, such as abdominal tumors, hernias, and adhesions from past surgery. Determine if the patient was involved in an accident — even a seemingly minor one, such as falling off a stepladder — that may have caused vascular clots. Check for"

Be alert for the sudden absence of bowel sounds, especially in the postoperative patient or a patient with hypokalemia because there’s an increased risk of paralytic ileus. Monitor the patient’s vital signs and auscultate for bowel sounds every 2 to 4 hours. Severe pain, abdominal rigidity, guarding, and fever, accompanied by hypoactive bowel sounds, may indicate paralytic ileus from peritonitis. If these signs and symptoms occur, prepare for emergency interventions. (See “Bowel Sounds, Absent,” pages 106 to 108.) The patient with hypoactive bowel sounds may require GI suction and decompression, using a nasogastric or intestinal tube. If so, restrict the patient’s oral intake.

Bradycardia Bradycardia refers to a heart rate of less than 60 beats/minute. It occurs normally in young adults, trained athletes, and elderly people as well as during sleep. It’s also a normal response to vagal stimulation caused by coughing, vomiting, or straining during defecation. When bradycardia results from these causes, the heart rate rarely drops below 40 beats/minute. However, when it results from pathologic causes (such as cardiovascular disorders), the heart rate may be slower. By itself, bradycardia is a nonspecific sign. However, in conjunction with such symptoms as chest pain, dizziness, syncope, and shortness of breath, it can signal a life-threatening disorder.

Breast Nodule (See Also Breast Dimpling, Breast Pain, Breast Ulcer) [Breast lump] A commonly reported gynecologic sign, a breast nodule has two chief causes: benign breast disease and cancer. Benign breast disease, the leading cause of nodules, can stem from cyst formation in obstructed and dilated lactiferous ducts, hypertrophy or tumor formation in the ductal system, inflammation, or infection. Although fewer than 20% of breast nodules are malignant, the signs and symptoms of breast cancer aren’t easily distinguished from those of benign breast disease. Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women, but can occur occasionally in men, with signs and symptoms mimicking those found in women. Thus, breast nodules in both sexes should always be evaluated."

Ammonia breath odor reflects the long-term metabolic disturbances and biochemical abnormalities associated with uremia and end-stage chronic renal failure.

In animals, breath odor analysis has revealed toxic metabolites, such as dimethylamine and trimethylamine, which contribute to the “fishy” odor.

Carpopedal Spasm Carpopedal spasm is the violent, painful contraction of the muscles in the hands and feet. (See Recognizing Carpopedal Spasm, page 146.) It’s an important sign of tetany, a potentially life- threatening condition characterized by increased neuromuscular excitation and sustained muscle contraction. Tetany, not to be confused with tetanus, may be caused by hypocalcemia or alkalosis. Carpopedal spasm requires prompt evaluation and intervention. If the primary event isn’t treated promptly, the patient can also develop laryngospasm, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac and respiratory arrest.

EXAMINATION TIP Recognizing Carpopedal Spasm In the hand, carpopedal spasm involves adduction of the thumb over the palm, followed by flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints, extension of the interphalangeal joints (fingers together), adduction of the hyperextended fingers, and flexion of the wrist and elbow joints. Similar effects occur in the joints of the feet. Inspect the patient’s skin and fingernails, noting dryness or scaling and ridged, brittle nails. Medical Causes Hypocalcemia. Carpopedal spasm is an early sign of hypocalcemia.

During normal respiration, the thorax uniformly expands upward and outward and then contracts downward and inward. When this process is disrupted, breathing becomes uncoordinated, resulting in asymmetrical chest expansion. Asymmetrical chest expansion may develop suddenly or gradually and may affect one or both sides of the chest wall. It may occur as delayed expiration (chest lag), as abnormal movement during inspiration (for example, intercostal retractions, paradoxical movement, or chest-abdomen asynchrony), or as a unilateral absence of movement.

Palpate for lifts, heaves, thrills, gallops, tactile fremitus, and abdominal masses or tenderness. (See Chest Pain: Common Causes and Associated Findings, pages 156 and 157.) Medical Causes Angina pectoris. With angina pectoris, the patient may experience a feeling of tightness or pressure in the chest that he describes as pain or a sensation of indigestion or expansion. The pain usually occurs in the retrosternal region over a palm-sized or larger area. It may radiate to the neck, jaw, and arms — classically, to the inner aspect of the left arm.

You may hear an atrial gallop (a fourth heart sound) or murmur during an anginal episode. With Prinzmetal’s angina, caused by vasospasm of coronary vessels, chest pain typically occurs when the patient is at rest — or it may awaken him. It may be accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and palpitations. During an attack, you may hear an atrial gallop. Anthrax (inhalation).

Although the disease most commonly occurs in wild and domestic grazing animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, the spores can live in the soil for many years. The disease can occur in humans exposed to infected animals, tissue from infected animals, or biological warfare. Most natural cases occur in agricultural regions worldwide. Anthrax may occur in a cutaneous, inhalation, or GI form. Inhalation anthrax is caused by inhalation of aerosolized spores. Initial signs and symptoms are flulike and include a fever, chills, weakness, a cough, and chest pain. The disease generally occurs in two stages with a period of recovery after the initial signs and symptoms. The second stage develops abruptly with rapid deterioration marked by a fever, dyspnea, stridor, and hypotension, generally leading to death within 24 hours.

Other diseases, such as malaria and Hodgkin’s disease (Pel-Ebstein fever), produce intermittent chills with recurring high fever. Still others produce continuous chills for up to 1 hour, precipitating a high fever. (See Why Chills Accompany Fever.) Why Chills Accompany Fever Fever usually occurs when exogenous pyrogens activate endogenous pyrogens to reset the body’s thermostat to a higher level. At this higher set point, the body feels cold and responds through several compensatory mechanisms, including rhythmic muscle contractions or chills. These muscle contractions generate body heat and help produce fever. This flowchart outlines the events that link chills to fever."

Because fever commonly accompanies or follows chills, take his rectal temperature to obtain a baseline reading. Then, check his temperature often to monitor fluctuations and to determine his temperature curve. Typically, a localized infection produces a sudden onset of shaking chills, sweats, and high fever. A systemic infection produces intermittent chills with recurring episodes of high fever or continuous chills that may last up to 1 hour and precipitate a high fever.

Clubbing A nonspecific sign of pulmonary and cyanotic cardiovascular disorders, clubbing is the painless, usually bilateral increase in soft tissue around the terminal phalanges of the fingers or toes. (See Rare Causes of Clubbing, page 172.) It doesn’t involve changes in the underlying bone. With early clubbing, the normal 160-degree angle between the nail and the nail base approximates 180 degrees. As clubbing progresses, this angle widens and the base of the nail becomes visibly swollen. With late clubbing, the angle where the nail meets the now-convex nail base extends more than halfway up the nail."

Untreated, constipation can lead to headache, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort and can adversely affect the patient’s lifestyle and well-being. Constipation usually occurs when the urge to defecate is suppressed and the muscles associated with bowel movements remain contracted. Because the autonomic nervous system controls bowel movements — by sensing rectal distention from fecal contents and by stimulating the external sphincter — any factor that influences this system may cause bowel dysfunction. (See How Habits and Stress Cause Constipation, page 178.) History and Physical Examination Ask the patient to describe the frequency of his bowel movements and the size and consistency of his stools.

It’s one of the most common complaints of patients with respiratory disorders. Coughing is a protective mechanism that clears airway passages. However, a nonproductive cough is ineffective and can cause damage, such as airway collapse or rupture of alveoli or blebs. A nonproductive cough that later becomes productive is a classic sign of progressive respiratory disease, such as pneumonia. The cough reflex generally occurs when mechanical, chemical, thermal, inflammatory, or psychogenic stimuli activate cough receptors. (See Reviewing the Cough Mechanism, page 188.)

Someone with a chronic nonproductive cough may downplay or overlook it or accept it as normal. In fact, he generally won’t seek medical attention unless he has other symptoms.

How does the cough sound — harsh, brassy, dry, or hacking? Try to determine if the cough is related to smoking or a chemical irritant. If the patient smokes or has smoked, note the number of packs smoked daily multiplied by years (“pack-years”). Next, ask about the frequency and intensity of the coughing. If he has pain associated with coughing, breathing, or activity, when did it begin? Where is it located? Reviewing the Cough Mechanism Cough receptors are thought to be located in the nose, sinuses, auditory canals, nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, pleurae, diaphragm and, possibly, the pericardium and GI tract. When a cough receptor is stimulated, the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves transmit the impulse to the “cough center” in the medulla.

Deep inspiration (1) is followed by closure of the glottis (2), relaxation of the diaphragm, and contraction of the abdominal and intercostal muscles. The resulting increased pressure in the lungs opens the glottis to release the forceful, noisy expiration known as a cough (3)."

Ask the patient at risk for TB — one born in another country, in contact with acute TB, or with high- risk behaviors — about potential TB exposure. Next, perform a physical examination. Start by taking the patient’s vital signs. Check the depth and rhythm of his respirations, and note if wheezing or “crowing” noises occur with breathing. Feel the patient’s skin: Is it cold or warm, clammy, or dry? Check his nose and mouth for congestion, inflammation, drainage, or signs of infection. Inspect his neck for distended jugular veins and tracheal deviation, and palpate for masses or enlarged lymph nodes.

Deep Tendon Reflexes, Hyperactive A hyperactive deep tendon reflex (DTR) is an abnormally brisk muscle contraction that occurs in response to a sudden stretch induced by sharply tapping the muscle’s tendon of insertion. This elicited sign may be graded as brisk or pathologically hyperactive. Hyperactive DTRs are commonly accompanied by clonus. Understanding the Reflex Arc The corticospinal tract and other descending tracts govern the reflex arc — the relay cycle that produces any reflex response. A corticospinal lesion above the level of the reflex arc being tested may result in hyperactive DTRs. Abnormal neuromuscular transmission at the end of the reflex arc may also cause hyperactive DTRs. For example, a calcium or magnesium deficiency m"

History and Physical Examination After eliciting hyperactive DTRs, take the patient’s history. Ask about spinal cord injury or other trauma and about prolonged exposure to cold, wind, or water. Could the patient be pregnant? A positive response to any of these questions requires prompt evaluation to rule out life-threatening autonomic hyperreflexia, tetanus, preeclampsia, or hypothermia. Ask about the onset and progression of associated signs and symptoms. Next, perform a neurologic examination. Evaluate the patient’s level of consciousness, and test motor and sensory function in the limbs. Ask about paresthesia. Check for ataxia or tremors and for speech and visual deficits.

Stress the importance of compliance with antidepressant medications, and review adverse reactions. Pediatric Pointers Because emotional lability is normal in adolescence, depression can be difficult to assess and diagnose in teenagers. Clues to underlying depression may include somatic complaints, sexual promiscuity, poor grades, and alcohol or drug abuse. Using a family systems model usually helps determine the cause of depression in adolescents. After family roles are determined, family therapy or group therapy with peers may help the patient overcome her depression. In severe cases, an antidepressant may be required.

Even a frail nursing home resident with these characteristics may have the strength to kill herself. Diaphoresis Diaphoresis is profuse sweating — at times, amounting to more than 1 L of sweat per hour. This sign represents an autonomic nervous system response to physical or psychogenic stress or to a fever or high environmental temperature.

When caused by a fever or high environmental temperature, it’s usually generalized. Diaphoresis usually begins abruptly and may be accompanied by other autonomic system signs, such as tachycardia and increased blood pressure. (See When Diaphoresis Spells Crisis, page 230.) However, this sign also varies with age because sweat glands function immaturely in infants and are less active in elderly patients. As a result, patients in these age groups may fail to display diaphoresis associated with its common causes. Intermittent diaphoresis may accompany chronic disorders characterized by a recurrent fever; isolated diaphoresis may mark an episode of acute pain or fever."

    "text": "Night sweats may characterize intermittent fever because body temperature tends to return to normal between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. before rising again. (Temperature is usually lowest around 6 a.m.) When caused by a high external temperature, diaphoresis is a normal response. Acclimatization usually requires several days of exposure to high temperatures; during this process, diaphoresis helps maintain normal body temperature. Diaphoresis also commonly occurs during menopause, preceded by a sensation of intense heat (a hot flash). Other causes include exercise or exertion that accelerates metabolism, creating internal heat, and mild to moderate anxiety that helps initiate the fight-or-flight response.

Episodes of dizziness are usually brief; they may be mild or severe with an abrupt or a gradual onset. Dizziness may be aggravated by standing up quickly and alleviated by lying down and by rest. Dizziness typically results from inadequate blood flow and oxygen supply to the cerebrum and spinal cord. It may occur with anxiety, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, and postconcussion syndrome. It’s a key symptom in certain serious disorders, such as hypertension and vertebrobasilar artery insufficiency.

Pediatric Pointers Dizziness is less common in children than in adults. Many children have difficulty describing this symptom and instead complain of tiredness, stomachache, or feeling sick. If you suspect dizziness, assess for vertigo as well. A more common symptom in children, vertigo may result from a vision disorder, an ear infection, or antibiotic therapy. REFERENCES Fife, T. D.

Whether it occurs abruptly or gradually, dysarthria is usually evident in ordinary conversation. It’s confirmed by asking the patient to produce a few simple sounds and words, such as “ba,” “sh,” and “cat.” However, dysarthria is occasionally confused with aphasia, the loss of the ability to produce or comprehend speech. Dysarthria results from damage to the brain stem that affects cranial nerves IX, X, or XII. Degenerative neurologic disorders and cerebellar disorders commonly cause dysarthria. In fact, dysarthria is a chief sign of olivopontocerebellar degeneration. It may also result from ill-fitting dentures.

Cervical stenosis. Cervical stenosis is a structural disorder that causes dysmenorrhea and scant or absent menstrual flow. Endometriosis. Endometriosis typically produces steady, aching pain that begins before menses and peaks at the height of menstrual flow; however, the pain may also occur between menstrual periods. The pain may arise at the endometrial deposit site or may radiate to the perineum or rectum. Associated signs and symptoms include premenstrual spotting, dyspareunia, infertility, nausea and vomiting, painful defecation, and rectal bleeding and hematuria during menses.

Dyspepsia is caused by GI disorders and, to a lesser extent, by cardiac, pulmonary, and renal disorders and the effects of drugs. It apparently results when altered gastric secretions lead to excess stomach acidity. This symptom may also result from emotional upset, eating too much or too fast, or improper chewing. It usually occurs a few hours after eating and lasts for a variable period. Its severity depends on the amount and type of food eaten and on GI motility.

Classifying Dysphagia Because swallowing occurs in three distinct phases, dysphagia can be classified by the phase that it affects. Each phase suggests a specific pathology for dysphagia. PHASE 1 Swallowing begins in the transfer phase with chewing and moistening of food with saliva. The tongue presses against the hard palate to transfer the chewed food to the back of the throat; cranial nerve V then stimulates the swallowing reflex. Phase 1 dysphagia typically results from a neuromuscular disorder. PHASE 2 In the transport phase, the soft palate closes against the pharyngeal wall to prevent nasal regurgitation. At the same time, the larynx rises and the vocal cords close to keep food out of the lungs; breathing stops momentarily as the throat muscles constrict to move food into the esophagus. Phase 2 dysphagia usually indicates spasm or cancer. PHASE 3 Peristalsis and gravity work together in the entrance"

Dystonia is a common adverse effect of these drugs, and the dosage may need to be adjusted to minimize this effect. Next, examine the patient’s coordination and voluntary muscle movement. Observe his gait as he walks across the room; then, have him squeeze your fingers to assess muscle strength. (See Recognizing dystonia, page 270.) Check coordination by having him touch your fingertip and then his nose repeatedly. Follow this by testing gross motor movement of the leg: Have him place his heel on one knee, slide it down his shin to the top of his great toe, and then, return it to his knee.

EXAMINATION TIP Recognizing Dystonia Dystonia, chorea, and athetosis may occur simultaneously. To differentiate between these three, keep these points in mind. Dystonic movements are slow and twisting and involve large muscle groups in the head, neck (as shown below), trunk, and limbs. They may be intermittent or continuous. Choreiform movements are rapid, highly complex, and jerky. Athetoid movements are slow, sinuous, and writhing, but always continuous; they typically affect the hands and extremities.

Understanding Fluid Balance Normally, fluid moves freely between the interstitial and intravascular spaces to maintain homeostasis. Four basic pressures control fluid shifts across the capillary membrane that separates these spaces: Capillary hydrostatic pressure (the internal fluid pressure on the capillary membrane) Interstitial fluid pressure (the external fluid pressure on the capillary membrane) Osmotic pressure (the fluid-attracting pressure from protein concentration within the capillary) Interstitial osmotic pressure (the fluid-attracting pressure from protein concentration outside the capillary) Here’s how these pressures main"

Normally, capillary hydrostatic pressure is greater than plasma osmotic pressure at the capillary’s arterial end, forcing fluid out of the capillary. At the capillary’s venous end, the reverse is true: The plasma osmotic pressure is greater than the capillary hydrostatic pressure, drawing fluid into the capillary. Normally, the lymphatic system transports excess interstitial fluid back to the intravascular space. Edema results when this balance is upset by increased capillary permeability, lymphatic obstruction, persistently increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, decreased plasma osmotic or interstitial fluid pressure, or dilation of precapillary sphincters."

It may result from cardiac, renal, endocrine, lymphatic, or hepatic disorders as well as from severe burns, malnutrition, the effects of certain drugs and treatments, and after having a mastectomy. Common factors responsible for edema are hypoalbuminemia and excess sodium ingestion or retention, both of which influence plasma osmotic pressure. (See Understanding Fluid Balance.) Cyclic edema associated with increased aldosterone secretion may occur in premenopausal women. EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS Quickly determine the location and severity of edema, including the degree of pitting. (See Edema: Pitting or Nonpitting?) If the patient has severe edema, promptly take his vital signs, and check for jugular vein distention and cyanotic lips. Auscultate the lungs and heart. Be alert for signs of cardiac failure or pulmonary congestion, such as crackles, muffled heart sounds, or a ventricular gallop. Unless the patient is hypotensive, place"

Unless the patient is hypotensive, place him in Fowler’s position to promote lung expansion. Prepare to administer oxygen and an I.V. diuretic. Have emergency resuscitation equipment nearby. EXAMINATION TIP Edema: Pitting or Nonpitting? To differentiate pitting from nonpitting edema, press your finger against a swollen area for 5 seconds and then quickly remove it. With pitting edema, pressure forces fluid into the underlying tissues, causing an indentation that slowly fills. To determine the severity of pitting edema, estimate the indentation’s depth in centimeters: 1+ (1 cm), 2+ (2 cm), 3+ (3 cm), or 4+ (4 cm). With nonpitting edema, pressure leaves no indentation because fluid has coagulated in the tissues. Typically, the skin feels unusually tight and firm."

Does it move throughout the course of the day — for example, from the upper extremities to the lower, periorbitally, or within the sacral area? Is the edema worse in the morning or at the end of the day? Is it affected by position changes? Is it accompanied by shortness of breath or pain in the arms or legs? Find out how much weight the patient has gained. Has his urine output changed in quantity or quality? Next, ask about previous burns or cardiac, renal, hepatic, endocrine, or GI disorders. Have the patient describe his diet so you can determine whether he suffers from protein malnutrition. Explore his drug history, and note recent I.V. therapy.

Patients may display generalized edema of the body with a “puffy” appearance during the advanced stages of cirrhosis. As the disease progresses, healthy liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue that ultimately leads to inadequate liver function. In addition, patients may also have edema in lower areas of the body, displayed in the legs and abdomen (ascites). Other symptoms include difficulty concentrating, sleeping problems, poor memory, jaundice, and dark-colored urine. Heart failure.

Edema of the Leg Leg edema is a common sign that results when excess interstitial fluid accumulates in one or both legs. It may affect just the foot and ankle or extend to the thigh, and may be slight or dramatic, pitting or nonpitting. Leg edema may result from venous disorders, trauma, and certain bone and cardiac disorders that disturb normal fluid balance. (See Understanding Fluid Balance, page 278.) It may result from nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, acute and chronic thrombophlebitis, chronic venous insufficiency (most common), cellulitis, lymphedema, and drugs. However, several nonpathologic mechanisms may also cause leg edema. For example, prolonged sitting, standing, or immobility may cause bilateral orthostatic edema. This pitting edema usually affects the foot and disappears with rest and leg elevation. Increased venous pressure late in pregnancy may cause ankle edema. Constr"

History and Physical Examination To evaluate the patient, first ask how long he has had the edema. Did it develop suddenly or gradually? Does it decrease if he elevates his legs? Is it painful when touched or when he walks? Is it worse in the morning, or does it get progressively worse during the day? Ask about a recent leg injury or recent surgery or illness that may have immobilized the patient. Does he have a history of cardiovascular disease? Finally, obtain a drug history. Begin the physical examination by examining each leg for pitting edema. (See Edema: Pitting or Nonpitting? page 279.)

Psychological stress, probably the most important factor, commonly results from the birth of a sibling, the death of a parent or loved one, divorce, or premature, rigorous toilet training. The child may be too embarrassed or ashamed to discuss his bed- wetting, which intensifies psychological stress and makes enuresis more likely — thus creating a vicious circle.

Epistaxis ranges from mild oozing to severe — possibly life-threatening — blood loss. A rich supply of fragile blood vessels makes the nose particularly vulnerable to bleeding. Air moving through the nose can dry and irritate the mucous membranes, forming crusts that bleed when they’re removed; dry mucous membranes are also more susceptible to infection, which can produce epistaxis as well.

With allergic conjunctivitis, a bilateral, white, ropey discharge is accompanied by itching and tearing. Bacterial conjunctivitis causes a moderate purulent or mucopurulent discharge that may form sticky crusts on the eyelids during sleep. The discharge is commonly greenish or yellowish and usually occurs in one eye. The patient may also experience itching, burning, excessive tearing, and the sensation of a foreign body in the eye. Eye pain indicates corneal involvement. Preauricular adenopathy is uncommon. Viral conjunctivitis is generally more common than the bacterial form. A serous, clear discharge and preauricular adenopathy are usually present.

These contractions cause visible dimpling or wavelike twitching of the skin, but they aren’t strong enough to cause a joint to move. They occur irregularly at frequencies ranging from once every several seconds to two or three times per second; infrequently, myokymia — continuous, rapid fasciculations that cause a rippling effect — may occur. Because fasciculations are brief and painless, they commonly go undetected or are ignored. Benign, nonpathologic fasciculations are common and normal. They typically occur in tense, anxious, or overtired people and typically affect the eyelid, thumb, or calf. However, fasciculations may also indicate a severe neurologic disorder, most notably a diffuse motor neuron disorder that causes loss of control over muscle fiber discharge. They’re also an early sign of pesticide poisoning."

This common symptom is distinct from weakness, which involves the muscles, but may occur with it. Fatigue is a normal and important response to physical overexertion, prolonged emotional stress, and sleep deprivation. However, it can also be a nonspecific symptom of a psychological or physiologic disorder — especially viral or bacterial infection and endocrine, cardiovascular, or neurologic disease. Fatigue reflects hypermetabolic and hypometabolic states in which nutrients needed for cellular energy and growth are lacking because of overly rapid depletion, impaired replacement mechanisms, insufficient hormone production, or inadequate nutrient intake or metabolism.

If not contraindicated, check for fecal impaction, which may be associated with incontinence. Neurologic Control of Defecation Three neurologic mechanisms normally regulate defecation: the intrinsic defecation reflex in the colon, the parasympathetic defecation reflex involving sacral segments of the spinal cord, and voluntary control. Here’s how they interact. Fecal distention of the rectum activates the relatively weak intrinsic reflex, causing afferent impulses to spread through the myenteric plexus, initiating peristalsis in the descending and sigmoid colon and rectum.

To ensure defecation, the parasympathetic reflex magnifies the intrinsic reflex. Stimulation of afferent nerves in the rectal wall propels impulses through the spinal cord and back to the descending and sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus to intensify peristalsis. However, fecal movement and internal sphincter relaxation cause immediate contraction of the external anal sphincter and temporary fecal retention. At this point, conscious control of the external sphincter either prevents or permits defecation. Except in infants or neurologically impaired patients, this voluntary mechanism further contracts the sphincter to prevent defecation at inappropriate times or relaxes it and allows defecation to occur."

Special Considerations Effective treatment of hepatic encephalopathy reduces blood ammonia levels by eliminating ammonia from the GI tract. You may have to administer neomycin or lactulose to suppress bacterial production of ammonia, give sorbitol solution to induce osmotic diarrhea, give potassium supplements to correct alkalosis, provide continuous gastric aspiration of blood, or maintain the patient on a low-protein diet. If these methods prove unsuccessful, hemodialysis or plasma exchange transfusions may be performed.

    "text": "Fever [Pyrexia] A fever is a common sign that can arise from many disorders. Because these disorders can affect virtually any body system, a fever in the absence of other signs usually has little diagnostic significance. A persistent high fever, though, represents an emergency. A fever can be classified as low (oral reading of 99°F to 100.4°F [37.2°C to 38°C]), moderate (100.5°F to 104°F [38°C to 40°C]), or high (above 104°F). A fever greater than 106°F (41.1°C) causes unconsciousness and, if sustained, leads to permanent brain damage. A fever may also be classified as remittent, intermittent, sustained, relapsing, or undulant. Remittent fever, the most common type, is characterized by daily temperature fluctuations above the normal range. Intermittent fever is marked by a daily temperature drop into the normal range and then a rise back to above normal. An intermittent fever that fluctuates widely, typically producing chills and sweating, is called hectic, or septic, fever. Sustained"

An intermittent fever that fluctuates widely, typically producing chills and sweating, is called hectic, or septic, fever. Sustained fever involves persistent temperature elevation with little fluctuation. Relapsing fever consists of alternating feverish and afebrile periods. Undulant fever refers to a gradual increase in temperature that stays high for a few days and then decreases gradually. Further classification involves duration — either brief (less than 3 weeks) or prolonged. Prolonged fevers include fever of unknown origin, a classification used when careful examination fails to detect an underlying cause.

Fontanel, Bulging In a normal infant, the anterior fontanel, or “soft spot,” is flat, soft yet firm, and well demarcated against surrounding skull bones. The posterior fontanel shouldn’t be fused at birth but may be overriding following the birthing process. This fontanel usually closes by age 3 months. (See Locating Fontanels.) Subtle pulsations may be visible, reflecting the arterial pulse. EXAMINATION TIP Locating Fontanels The anterior fontanel lies at the junction of the sagittal, coronal, and frontal sutures.

Gait, Scissors Resulting from bilateral spastic paresis (diplegia), scissors gait affects both legs and has little or no effect on the arms. The patient’s legs flex slightly at the hips and knees, so he looks as if he’s crouching. With each step, his thighs adduct and his knees hit or cross in a scissors-like movement. (See Identifying Gait Abnormalities, pages 336 and 337.) His steps are short, regular, and laborious, as if he were wading through waist-deep water. His feet may be plantar flexed and turned inward, with a shortened Achilles tendon; as a result, he walks on his toes or on the balls of his feet and may scrape his toes on the ground.

It may be present when the child begins to walk or may appear only later in life. The gait results from deterioration of the pelvic girdle muscles — primarily the gluteus medius, hip flexors, and hip extensors. Weakness in these muscles hinders stabilization of the weight-bearing hip during walking, causing the opposite hip to drop and the trunk to lean toward that side in an attempt to maintain balance. (See Identifying Gait Abnormalities, pages 336 and 337.) Typically, the legs assume a wide stance, and the trunk is thrown back to further improve stability, exaggerating lordosis, and abdominal protrusion.

Common later findings include lordosis with abdominal protrusion, a positive Gowers’ sign, and equinovarus foot position. As the disease progresses, its effects become more prominent; they commonly include rapid muscle wasting beginning in the legs and spreading to the arms (although calf and upper arm muscles may become hypertrophied, firm, and rubbery), muscle contractures, limited dorsiflexion of the feet and extension of the knees and elbows, obesity and, possibly,"

Although the physiologic S3 has the same timing as the pathologic S3, its intensity waxes and wanes with respiration. It’s also heard more faintly if the patient is sitting or standing. A pathologic ventricular gallop may be one of the earliest signs of ventricular failure. It may result from one of two mechanisms: rapid deceleration of blood entering a stiff, noncompliant ventricle or rapid acceleration of blood associated with increased flow into the ventricle.

Did it erupt after he began taking a new drug or after a trip out of the country? Has he had similar lesions before? If so, did he get medical treatment for them? Find out if he has been treating the lesion himself. If so, how? Does the lesion itch? If so, is the itching constant or does it bother him only at night? Note whether the lesion is painful. Ask for a description of any drainage from the lesions. Next, take a complete sexual history, noting the frequency of relations, number of sexual partners, and pattern of condom use."

Tight pants or underwear, especially those made of nonabsorbent fabrics, can promote the growth of bacteria and fungi. Examine the entire skin surface, noting the location, size, color, and pattern of the lesions. Do genital lesions resemble lesions on other parts of the body? Palpate for nodules, masses, and tenderness. Also, look for bleeding, edema, or signs of infection, such as purulent drainage or erythema. Finally, take the patient’s vital signs. Medical Causes Balanitis and balanoposthitis. Typically, balanitis (glans infection) and posthitis (prepuce infection) occur together (balanoposthitis), causing painful ulceration on the glans, foreskin, or penile shaft. Ulceration is usually preceded by 2 to 3 days of prepuce irritation and soreness, followed by a foul discharge and edema. The patient may then develop features of acute infection, such as a fever with chills, malaise, and dysuria. Without t"

Bowen’s disease is a painless, premalignant lesion that commonly occurs on the penis or scrotum but may also appear elsewhere. It appears as a brownish red, raised, scaly, indurated plaque with well-defined borders, which may ulcerate at its center. Chancroid. Chancroid is an STD that’s characterized by the eruption of one or more lesions, usually on the groin, inner thigh, or penis. Within 24 hours, the lesion changes from a reddened area to a small papule. (A similar papule may erupt on the tongue, lip, breast, or umbilicus.)

The inguinal lymph nodes also enlarge, become very tender, and may drain pus. Recognizing Common Male Genital Lesions Many lesions may affect the male genitalia. Some of the more common ones and their causes appear below. Penile cancer causes a painless ulcerative lesion on the glans or foreskin, possibly accompanied by a foul-smelling discharge. A fixed drug eruption causes a bright red to purplish lesion on the glans penis."

Gynecomastia Occurring only in males, gynecomastia refers to increased breast size due to excessive mammary gland development. This change in breast size may be barely palpable or immediately obvious. Usually bilateral, gynecomastia may be associated with breast tenderness and milk secretion. Normally, several hormones regulate breast development. Estrogens, growth hormone, and corticosteroids stimulate ductal growth, while progesterone and prolactin stimulate growth of the alveolar lobules. Although the pathophysiology of gynecomastia isn’t fully understood, a hormonal imbalance — particularly a change in the estrogen-androgen ratio and an increase in prolactin — is a likely contributing factor.

This effect can be explained by this physical principle: As light passes through water (in the eye, through tears or the cells of various anteretinal media), it breaks up into spectral colors. Halo vision usually develops suddenly; its duration depends on the causative disorder. It may occur with disorders associated with excessive tearing and corneal epithelial edema. Among these causes, the most common and significant is acute angle-closure glaucoma, which can lead to blindness. With this disorder, increased intraocular pressure (IOP) forces fluid into corneal tissues anterior to the Bowman’s membrane, causing edema. Halo vision is also an early symptom of cataracts, resulting from dispersion of light by abnormal opacities in the lens.

This common symptom may involve reception of low-, middle-, or high-frequency tones. If the hearing loss doesn’t affect speech frequencies, the patient may be unaware of it. Normally, sound waves enter the external auditory canal, and then travel to the middle ear’s tympanic membrane and ossicles (incus, malleus, and stapes) and into the inner ear’s cochlea. The cochlear division of cranial nerve (CN) VIII (auditory nerve) carries the sound impulse to the brain.

Mixed hearing loss combines aspects of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Functional hearing loss results from psychological factors rather than identifiable organic damage.

RINNE TEST Hold the base of a vibrating tuning fork against the patient's mastoid process to test bone conduction. Then quickly move the vibrating fork in front of her ear canal to test air conduction. Ask her to tell you which location has the louder or longer sound. Repeat the procedure for the other ear. In a positive Rinne test, air conduction lasts longer or sounds louder than bone conduction — a normal finding. In a negative test, the opposite is true: Bone conduction lasts longer or sounds louder than air conduction. After performing both tests, correlate the results with other assessment data."

Effect of volume loading on the Frank- Starling relation during reductions in central blood volume in heat stressed humans. Journal of Physiology, 588, 3333–3339. Hematemesis Hematemesis, the vomiting of blood, usually indicates GI bleeding above the ligament of Treitz, which suspends the duodenum at its junction with the jejunum. Bright red or blood-streaked vomitus indicates fresh or recent bleeding. Dark red, brown, or black vomitus (the color and consistency of coffee grounds) indicates that blood has been retained in the stomach and partially digested. Although hematemesis usually results from a GI disorder, it may stem from a coagulation disorder or a treatment that irritates the GI tract. Esophageal varices may also cause hematemesis. Swallowed blood from epistaxis or oropharyngeal erosion may also cause bloody vomitus. Hemateme"

Swallowed blood from epistaxis or oropharyngeal erosion may also cause bloody vomitus. Hematemesis may be precipitated by straining, emotional stress, and the use of an anti-inflammatory or alcohol. In a patient with esophageal varices, hematemesis may be a result of trauma from swallowing hard or partially chewed food. (See Rare Causes of Hematemesis.) Hematemesis is always an important sign, but its severity depends on the amount, source, and rapidity of the bleeding. Massive hematemesis (vomiting 500 to 1,000 mL of blood) may be life threatening. EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS If the patient has massive hematemesis, check his vital signs.

First, have the patient describe the amount, color, and consistency of the vomitus. When did he first notice this sign? Has he ever had hematemesis before?

Yellow fever also causes hematemesis as well as a sudden fever, bradycardia, jaundice, and severe prostration. Two relatively common disorders may cause hematemesis in rare cases. When acute diverticulitis affects the duodenum, GI bleeding and resultant hematemesis occur with abdominal pain and a fever. With GI involvement, secondary syphilis can cause hematemesis; more characteristic signs and symptoms include a primary chancre, a rash, a fever, weight loss, malaise, anorexia, and a headache. Next, ask about a history of ulcers or of liver or coagulation disorders. Find out how much alcohol the patient drinks, if any.

Hematuria A cardinal sign of renal and urinary tract disorders, hematuria is the abnormal presence of blood in urine. Strictly defined, it means three or more red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power microscopic field in urine. Microscopic hematuria is confirmed by an occult blood test, whereas macroscopic hematuria is immediately visible. However, macroscopic hematuria must be distinguished from pseudohematuria. (See Confirming Hematuria.) Macroscopic hematuria may be continuous or intermittent, is commonly accompanied by pain, and may be aggravated by prolonged standing or walking. Confirming Hematuria If the patient’s urine appears blood tinged, be sure to rule out pseudohematuria, red or pink urine caused by urinary pigments. First, carefully observe the urine specimen.

Ask about the patient’s intake of beets, berries, or foods with red dyes that may color the urine red. Be aware that porphyrinuria and excess urate excretion can also cause pseudohematuria. Finally, test the urine using a chemical reagent strip. This test can confirm even microscopic hematuria and can also estimate the amount of blood present. Hematuria may be classified by the stage of urination it predominantly affects. Bleeding at the start of urination — initial hematuria — usually indicates urethral pathology; bleeding at the end of urination — terminal hematuria — usually indicates pathology of the bladder neck, posterior urethra, or prostate; bleeding throughout urination — total hematuria — usually indicates pathology above the bladder neck."

Hematuria may result from one of two mechanisms: rupture or perforation of vessels in the renal system or urinary tract, or impaired glomerular filtration, which allows RBCs to seep into the urine. The color of the bloody urine provides a clue to the source of the bleeding. Generally, dark or brownish blood indicates renal or upper urinary tract bleeding, whereas bright red blood indicates lower urinary tract bleeding. Although hematuria usually results from renal and urinary tract disorders, it may also result from certain GI, prostate, vaginal, or coagulation disorders or from the effects of certain drugs.

It’s sometimes confused with bleeding from the mouth, throat, nasopharynx, or GI tract. (See Identifying Hemoptysis.) Expectoration of 200 mL of blood in a single episode suggests severe bleeding, whereas expectoration of 400 mL in 3 hours or more than 600 mL in 16 hours signals a life-threatening crisis. Hemoptysis usually results from chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, or bronchiectasis. However, it may also result from inflammatory, infectious, cardiovascular, or coagulation disorders and, rarely, from a ruptured aortic aneurysm. In up to 15% of patients, the cause is unknown. The most common causes of massive hemoptysis are lung cancer, bronchiectasis, active tuberculosis (TB), and cavitary pulmonary disease from necrotic infections or TB.

EXAMINATION TIP Identifying Hemoptysis These guidelines will help you distinguish hemoptysis from epistaxis, hematemesis, and brown, red, or pink sputum. HEMOPTYSIS Typically frothy because it's mixed with air, hemoptysis is typically bright red with an alkaline pH (tested with nitrazine paper). It's strongly suggested by the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms, including a cough, a tickling sensation in the throat, and blood produced from repeated coughing episodes. (You can rule out epistaxis because the patient's nasal passages and posterior pharynx are usually clear.) HEMATEMESIS The usual site of hematemesis is the GI tract; the patient vomits or regurgitates coffee-ground material that contains food particles, tests positive for occult blood, and has an acid pH. However, he may vomit bright red blood or swallowed blood from the oral cavity and nasopharynx. After an episode o"

Hepatotoxic drugs or drugs metabolized by the liver should be given in very small doses, if at all. These treatment measures should be explained to the patient.

Gastroesophageal reflux into the larynx should also be considered as a possible cause of chronic hoarseness. Hoarseness may also result from progressive atrophy of the laryngeal muscles and mucosa due to aging, which leads to diminished control of the vocal cords. History and Physical Examination Obtain a patient history. First, consider his age and sex; laryngeal cancer is most common in men between ages 50 and 70. Be sure to ask about the onset of hoarseness. Has the patient been overusing his voice? Has he experienced shortness of breath, a sore throat, a dry mouth, a cough, or difficulty swallowing dry food?

Impotence varies from occasional and minimal to permanent and complete. Occasional impotence occurs in about one-half of adult American men, whereas chronic impotence affects about 10 million American men. Impotence can be classified as primary or secondary. A man with primary impotence has never been potent with a sexual partner but may achieve normal erections in other situations. This uncommon condition is difficult to treat. Secondary impotence carries a more favorable prognosis because, despite his present erectile dysfunction, the patient has completed satisfactory intercourse in the past.

Pain in the calf (the most common area) or foot indicates disease of the femoral or popliteal arteries; pain in the buttocks and upper thigh, disease of the aortoiliac arteries. During exercise, the pain typically results from the release of lactic acid due to anaerobic metabolism in the ischemic segment, secondary to obstruction. When exercise stops, the lactic acid clears and the pain subsides. Intermittent claudication may also have a neurologic cause: narrowing of the vertebral column at the level of the cauda equina. This condition creates pressure on the nerve roots to the lower extremities. Walking stimulates circulation to the cauda equina, causing increased pressure on those nerves and resultant pain.

In fair-skinned patients, it’s most noticeable on the face, trunk, and sclera; in dark-skinned patients, on the hard palate, sclera, and conjunctiva. Jaundice is most apparent in natural sunlight. In fact, it may be undetectable in artificial or poor light. It’s commonly accompanied by pruritus (because bile pigment damages sensory nerves), dark urine, and clay-colored stools. Jaundice may result from any of three pathophysiologic processes. (See Jaundice: Impaired Bilirubin Metabolism.) It may be the only warning sign of certain disorders such as pancreatic cancer.

Red blood cells rupture faster than the liver can conjugate bilirubin, so large amounts of unconjugated bilirubin pass into the blood, causing increased intestinal conversion of this bilirubin to water-soluble urobilinogen for excretion in urine and stools. (Unconjugated bilirubin is insoluble in water, so it can’t be directly excreted in urine.) Hepatic jaundice results from the liver’s inability to conjugate or excrete bilirubin, leading to increased blood levels of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. This occurs with such disorders as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and metastatic cancer and during the prolonged use of drugs metabolized by the liver."

Shine a flashlight across the patient’s neck to create shadows that highlight his venous pulse. Be sure to distinguish jugular vein pulsations from carotid artery pulsations. One way to do this is to palpate the vessel: Arterial pulsations continue, whereas venous pulsations disappear with light finger pressure. Also, venous pulsations increase or decrease with changes in body position; arterial pulsations remain constant. Next, locate the highest point along the vein where you can see pulsations. Using a centimeter ruler, measure the distance between that high point and the sternal notch. Record this finding as well as the angle at which the patient was lying. A finding greater than 1¼″ to 1½″ (3 to 4 cm) above the sternal notch, with the head of the bed at a 45-degree angle, indicates jugular vein distention."

    "text": "L Leg Pain Although leg pain commonly signifies a musculoskeletal disorder, it can also result from a more serious vascular or neurologic disorder. The pain may arise suddenly or gradually and may be localized or affect the entire leg. Constant or intermittent, it may feel dull, burning, sharp, shooting, or tingling. Leg pain may affect locomotion, limiting weight bearing. Severe leg pain that follows cast application for a fracture may signal limb-threatening compartment syndrome. The sudden onset of severe leg pain in a patient with underlying vascular insufficiency may signal acute deterioration, possibly requiring an arterial graft or amputation. (See Highlighting Causes of Local Leg Pain, page 436.)

Low Birth Weight Two groups of neonates are born weighing less than the normal minimum birth weight of 5½ lb (2,500 g) — those who are born prematurely (before 37 weeks’ gestation) and those who are small for gestational age (SGA). Premature neonates weigh an appropriate amount for their gestational age and probably would have matured normally if carried to term. Conversely, SGA neonates weigh less than the normal amount for their age; however, their organs are mature. Differentiating between the two groups helps direct the search for a cause. In the premature neonate, low birth weight usually results from a disorder that prevents the uterus from retaining the fetus, interferes with the normal course of pregnancy, causes premature separation of the placenta, or stimulates uterine contractions before term. In the SGA neonate, intrauterine growth may be retarded by a disorder that inte"

Aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or alcohol can cause melena as a result of gastric irritation. Special Considerations Monitor the patient’s vital signs, and look closely for signs of hypovolemic shock. For general comfort, encourage bed rest, and keep the patient’s perianal area clean and dry to prevent skin irritation and breakdown.

Candidiasis is a common fungal infection that characteristically produces soft, elevated plaques on the buccal mucosa, tongue, and sometimes the palate, gingivae, and floor of the mouth; the plaques may be wiped away. The lesions of acute atrophic candidiasis are red and painful. The lesions of chronic hyperplastic candidiasis are white and firm. Localized areas of redness, pruritus, and a foul odor may be present. Discoid lupus erythematosus.

Also ask about associated signs and symptoms, such as weakness, pain, loss of sensation, and recent weight loss. Review the patient’s medical history for chronic illnesses; musculoskeletal or neurologic disorders, including trauma; and endocrine and metabolic disorders. Ask about his use of alcohol and drugs, particularly steroids."

Check all major muscle groups for size, tonicity, and strength. (See Testing Muscle Strength, pages 488 and 489.) Measure the circumference of all limbs, comparing sides. (See Measuring Limb Circumference.) Check for muscle contractures in all limbs by fully extending joints and noting pain or resistance. Complete the examination by palpating peripheral pulses for quality and rate, assessing sensory function in and around the atrophied area, and testing deep tendon reflexes (DTRs).

Find out when he first noticed the weakness; ask him whether it worsens with exercise or as the day progresses. Also ask about related symptoms, especially muscle or joint pain, altered sensory function, and fatigue. Obtain a medical history, noting especially chronic disease, such as hyperthyroidism; musculoskeletal or neurologic problems, including recent trauma; a family history of chronic muscle weakness, especially in males; and alcohol and drug use. Focus your physical examination on evaluating muscle strength. Test all major muscles bilaterally. (See Testing Muscle Strength, pages 488 and 489.)

Usually occurring during inspiration, nasal flaring may occasionally occur during expiration or throughout the respiratory cycle. It indicates respiratory dysfunction, ranging from mild difficulty to potentially life-threatening respiratory distress. EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS If you note nasal flaring in the patient, quickly evaluate his respiratory status. Absent breath sounds, cyanosis, diaphoresis, and tachycardia point to complete airway obstruction. As necessary, deliver back blows or abdominal thrusts (Heimlich’s maneuver) to relieve the obstruction. If these don’t clear the airway, emergency intubation or tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. If the patient’s airway isn’t obstructed but he displays breathing difficulty, give oxygen by nasal cannula or face mask and obtain baseline vital signs.

Be sure to check the patient’s airway and his neurovascular status to ensure that the collar isn’t too tight. Also, make sure that the collar isn’t placed too high in front, which can hyperextend the neck. In a patient with a neck sprain, hyperextension may cause the ligaments to heal in a shortened position; in a patient with a cervical spine fracture, it could cause serious neurologic damage."

Focus your physical examination on palpating and percussing the kidneys, CVA, and bladder. Carefully inspect the urinary meatus. Inspect a urine specimen for color, odor, and the presence of sediment. Medical Causes Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Common in men older than age 50, BPH produces nocturia when significant urethral obstruction develops. Typically, it causes frequency, hesitancy, incontinence, reduced force and caliber of the urine stream, and, possibly, hematuria. Oliguria may also occur.

This common sign may result from ocular, neurologic, endocrine, and systemic disorders that interfere with the muscles, nerves, or brain centers governing eye movement. Occasionally, it signals a life-threatening disorder such as a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. (See Ocular Deviation: Its Characteristics and Causes in Cranial Nerve Damage, page 522.) Normally, eye movement is directly controlled by the extraocular muscles innervated by the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves (cranial nerves III, IV, and VI). Together, these muscles and nerves direct a visual stimulus to fall on corresponding parts of the retina. Disconjugate ocular deviation may result from unequal muscle tone (nonparalytic strabismus) or muscle paralysis associated with cranial nerve damage (paralytic strabismus).

Although some variation is normal, menstrual bleeding at intervals of greater than 36 days may indicate oligomenorrhea — abnormally infrequent menstrual bleeding characterized by three to six menstrual cycles per year. When menstrual bleeding does occur, it’s usually profuse, prolonged (up to 10 days), and laden with clots and tissue. Occasionally, scant bleeding or spotting occurs between these heavy menses. Oligomenorrhea may develop suddenly, or it may follow a period of gradually lengthening cycles. Although oligomenorrhea may alternate with normal menstrual bleeding, it can progress to secondary amenorrhea.

Oliguria A cardinal sign of renal and urinary tract disorders, oliguria is clinically defined as urine output of less than 400 mL/24 hours. Typically, this sign occurs abruptly and may herald serious — possibly life-threatening — hemodynamic instability. Its causes can be classified as prerenal (decreased renal blood flow), intrarenal (intrinsic renal damage), or postrenal (urinary tract obstruction); the pathophysiology differs for each classification. (See How Oliguria Develops, pages 528 and 529.) Oliguria associated with a prerenal or postrenal cause is usually promptly reversible with treatment, although it may lead to intrarenal damage if untreated.

Orthopnea Orthopnea — difficulty breathing in the supine position — is a common symptom of cardiopulmonary disorders that produce dyspnea. It’s usually a subtle symptom; the patient may complain that he can’t catch his breath when lying down, or he may mention that he sleeps most comfortably in a reclining chair or propped up by pillows. Derived from this complaint is the common classification of two- or three-pillow orthopnea. Orthopnea presumably results from increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vasculature related to gravitational effects in the supine position.

In cultures where mothers carry neonates on their backs or hips, such as in the Far East and Africa, hip dysplasia is rarely seen. Special Considerations Ortolani’s sign can be elicited only during the first 4 to 6 weeks of life; this is also the optimum time for effective corrective treatment.

Although generalized pallor affects the entire body, it’s most apparent on the face, conjunctiva, oral mucosa, and nail beds. Localized pallor commonly affects a single limb. How easily pallor is detected varies with skin color and the thickness and vascularity of underlying subcutaneous tissue. At times, it’s merely a subtle lightening of skin color that may be difficult to detect in dark-skinned persons; sometimes it’s evident only on the conjunctiva and oral mucosa. Pallor may result from decreased peripheral oxyhemoglobin or decreased total oxyhemoglobin. The former reflects diminished peripheral blood flow associated with peripheral vasoconstriction or arterial occlusion or with low cardiac output. (Transient peripheral vasoconstriction may occur with exposure to cold, causing nonpathologic pallor.) The latter usually results from anemia, the chief cause of pallor. (See How Pallor"

With arterial occlusive disease, pallor is specific to an extremity — usually one leg, but occasionally, both legs or an arm. It develops gradually from obstructive arteriosclerosis or a thrombus and is aggravated by elevating the extremity. Associated findings include intermittent claudication, weakness, cool skin, diminished pulses in the extremity and, possibly, ulceration and gangrene. Frostbite. Pallor is localized to the frostbitten area, such as the feet, hands, or ears. Typically, the area feels cold, waxy and, perhaps, hard in deep frostbite. The skin doesn’t blanch, and sensation may be absent. As the area thaws, the skin turns purplish blue. Blistering and gangrene may then follow if the frostbite is severe."

A common symptom of many neurologic disorders, paresthesia may also result from a systemic disorder or particular drug. It may reflect damage or irritation of the parietal lobe, thalamus, spinothalamic tract, or spinal or peripheral nerves — the neural circuit that transmits and interprets sensory stimuli. History and Physical Examination First, explore the paresthesia. When did abnormal sensations begin? Have the patient describe their character and distribution. Also, ask about associated signs and symptoms, such as sensory loss and paresis or paralysis. Next, take a medical history, including neurologic, cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, and chronic inflammatory disorders, such as arthritis or lupus.

If you don’t detect the classic three-component sound, you can distinguish a pericardial friction rub from a murmur by auscultating again and asking yourself these questions: HOW DEEP IS THE SOUND?

The pain worsens when the patient breathes deeply, coughs, or lies flat and, possibly, when he swallows. It abates when he sits up and leans forward. The patient may also develop a fever, dyspnea, tachycardia, and arrhythmias.

Its three sound components are linked to phases of the cardiac cycle. The presystolic component (A) reflects atrial systole and precedes the first heart sound (S1). The systolic component (B) — usually the loudest — reflects ventricular systole and occurs between the S1 and second heart sound (S2). The early diastolic component (C) reflects ventricular diastole and follows S2. Sometimes, the early diastolic component merges with the presystolic component, producing a diphasic to-and-fro sound on auscultation. In other patients, auscultation may detect only one component — a monophasic rub, typically during ventricular systole.

Peristaltic Waves, Visible With intestinal obstruction, peristalsis temporarily increases in strength and frequency as the intestine contracts to force its contents past the obstruction. As a result, visible peristaltic waves may roll across the abdomen. Typically, these waves appear suddenly and vanish quickly because increased peristalsis overcomes the obstruction or the GI tract becomes atonic. Peristaltic waves are best detected by stooping at the patient’s side and inspecting his abdominal contour while he’s in a supine position. Visible peristaltic waves may also reflect normal stomach and intestinal contractions in thin patients or in malnourished patients with abdominal muscle atrophy. History and Physical Examination"

It may occur with any psychiatric disorder, but is more common with schizophrenia. Signs of psychiatric disturbances, such as anxiety or depression, are typical. Other findings include a headache, blurred vision, weight gain, edema, elevated blood pressure and, occasionally, stupor and coma. Signs of heart failure may develop with overhydration. Renal disorders (chronic). Chronic renal disorders, such as glomerulonephritis and pyelonephritis, damage the kidneys, causing polydipsia and polyuria. Associated signs and symptoms include nocturia, weakness, elevated blood pressure, pallor and, in later stages, oliguria. Sheehan’s syndrome.

Polyuria is aggravated by overhydration, consumption of caffeine or alcohol, and excessive ingestion of salt, glucose, or other hyperosmolar substances. (See Polyuria: Common Causes and Associated Findings, pages 578 and 579.) Polyuria usually results from the use of certain drugs, such as a diuretic, or from a psychological, neurologic, or renal disorder. It can reflect central nervous system dysfunction that diminishes or suppresses antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, which regulates fluid balance. Or, when ADH levels are normal, it can reflect renal impairment. In both of these pathophysiologic mechanisms, the renal tubules fail to reabsorb sufficient water, causing polyuria.

Medical Causes Anemia (iron deficiency). Iron deficiency anemia occasionally produces pruritus. Initially asymptomatic, anemia can later cause exertional dyspnea, fatigue, listlessness, pallor, irritability, a headache, tachycardia, poor muscle tone and, possibly, murmurs. Chronic anemia causes spoon-shaped (koilonychia) and brittle nails (cheilosis), cracked mouth corners, a smooth tongue (glossitis), and dysphagia. Anthrax (cutaneous).

Cutaneous anthrax occurs when the bacterium enters a cut or an abrasion on the skin. The infection begins as a small, painless or pruritic macular or papular lesion resembling an insect bite. Within 1 to 2 days, it develops into a vesicle and then a painless ulcer with a characteristic black, necrotic center. Lymphadenopathy, malaise, a headache, or a fever may develop. Conjunctivitis. All forms of conjunctivitis cause eye itching, burning, and pain along with photophobia, conjunctival injection, a foreign body sensation, excessive tearing, and a feeling of fullness around the eye. Allergic conjunctivitis may also cause milky redness and a stringy eye discharge. Bacterial conjunctivitis typically causes brilliant redness and a mucopurulent discharge that may make the eyelids stick together. Fungal conjunctivitis produces a thick,"

Viral conjunctivitis may cause copious tearing — but little discharge — and preauricular lymph node enlargement. Dermatitis. Several types of dermatitis can cause pruritus accompanied by a skin lesion. Atopic dermatitis begins with intense, severe pruritus and an erythematous rash on dry skin at flexion points (antecubital fossa, popliteal area, and neck). During a flareup, scratching may produce edema, scaling, and pustules. With chronic atopic dermatitis, lesions may progress to dry, scaly skin with white dermatographia, blanching, and lichenification.

Widened pulse pressure — a difference of more than 50 mm Hg — commonly occurs as a physiologic response to a fever, hot weather, exercise, anxiety, anemia, or pregnancy. However, it can also result from certain neurologic disorders — especially life-threatening increased intracranial pressure (ICP) — or from cardiovascular disorders that cause blood backflow into the heart with each contraction such as aortic insufficiency.

Although pulse rhythm remains regular, strong and weak contractions alternate. (See Comparing Arterial Pressure Waves , page 608.) An alteration in the intensity of heart sounds and of existing heart murmurs may accompany this sign. Pulsus alternans is thought to result from the change in stroke volume that occurs with beat-to-beat alteration in the left ventricle’s contractility.

Pulsus paradoxus commonly occurs with cardiac tamponade, but it may be difficult to detect if intrapericardial pressure rises abruptly and profound hypotension occurs. With severe tamponade, assessment also reveals these classic findings: hypotension, diminished or muffled heart sounds, and jugular vein distention. Related findings include chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, narrowed pulse pressure, anxiety, restlessness, clammy skin, and hepatomegaly. Characteristic respiratory signs and symptoms include dyspnea, tachypnea, and cyanosis; the patient typically sits up and leans forward to facilitate breathing.

Normally, when a light is shined directly onto the retina of one eye, the parasympathetic nerves are stimulated to cause brisk constriction of that pupil — the direct light reflex. The pupil of the opposite eye also constricts — the consensual light reflex. The optic nerve (cranial nerve [CN] II) mediates the afferent arc of this reflex from each eye, whereas the oculomotor nerve (CN III) mediates the efferent arc to both eyes.

Although the anal canal is separated from the rest of the rectum by the internal sphincter, the patient may refer to all local pain as rectal pain. Because the mucocutaneous border of the anal canal and the perianal skin contains somatic nerve fibers, lesions in this area are especially painful. This pain may result from or be aggravated by diarrhea, constipation, or passage of hardened stools. It may also be aggravated by intense pruritus and continued scratching associated with drainage of mucus, blood, or fecal matter that irritates the skin and nerve endings. History and Physical Examination If the patient reports rectal pain, inspect the area for bleeding; abnormal drainage, such as pus; or protrusions, such as skin tags or thrombosed hemorrhoids.

Retractions, Costal and Sternal A cardinal sign of respiratory distress in infants and children, retractions are visible indentations of the soft tissue covering the chest wall. They may be suprasternal (directly above the sternum and clavicles), intercostal (between the ribs), subcostal (below the lower costal margin of the rib cage), or substernal (just below the xiphoid process). Retractions may be mild or severe, producing barely visible to deep indentations. Normally, infants and young children use abdominal muscles for breathing, unlike older children and adults, who use the diaphragm. When breathing requires extra effort, accessory muscles assist respiration, especially inspiration. Retractions typically accompany accessory muscle use.

Usually located within the central 30-degree area, the defect ranges from absolute blindness to a barely detectable loss of visual acuity. Typically, the patient can pinpoint the scotoma’s location in the visual field. (See Locating Scotomas, page 646.) A scotoma can result from a retinal, choroidal, or optic nerve disorder. It can be classified as absolute, relative, or scintillating. An absolute scotoma refers to the total inability to see all sizes of test objects used in mapping the visual field. A relative scotoma, in contrast, refers to the ability to see only large test objects. A scintillating scotoma refers to the flashes or bursts of light commonly seen during a migraine headache.

Possible complications include respiratory arrest due to airway obstruction from secretions, status epilepticus (occurring in 5% to 8% of patients), head or spinal injuries and bruises, Todd’s paralysis, and, rarely, cardiac arrest.

Life-threatening status epilepticus is marked by prolonged seizure activity or by rapidly recurring seizures with no intervening periods of recovery. It’s most commonly triggered by the abrupt discontinuation of anticonvulsant therapy. Generalized seizures may be caused by a brain tumor, vascular disorder, head trauma, infection, metabolic defect, drug or alcohol withdrawal syndrome, exposure to toxins, or a genetic defect. Generalized seizures may also result from a focal seizure. With recurring seizures, or epilepsy, the cause may be unknown. EMERGENCY INTERVENTIONS"

Place a towel under his head to prevent injury, loosen his clothing, and move any sharp or hard objects out of his way. Never try to restrain the patient or force a hard object into his mouth; you might chip his teeth or fracture his jaw.

Setting Sun Sign[Sunset eyes] Setting sun sign refers to the downward deviation of an infant’s or a young child’s eyes as a result of pressure on cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. With this late and ominous sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), both eyes are rotated downward, typically revealing an area of sclera above the irises; occasionally, the irises appear to be forced outward. Pupils are sluggish, responding to light unequally. (See Identifying Setting Sun Sign.) The infant with increased ICP is typically irritable and lethargic and feeds poorly. Changes in the level of consciousness (LOC), lower extremity spasticity, and opisthotonos may also be obvious. Increased ICP typically results from space-occupying lesions — such as tumors — or from an accumulation of fluid in the brain’s ventricular system, as occurs with hydrocephalus. It also results from intracranial bleeding or cerebral edema. Other"

It also results from intracranial bleeding or cerebral edema. Other signs include a globular appearance of the head (light bulb sign), a loss of upgaze, and distended scalp veins. Setting sun sign may be intermittent — for example, it may disappear when the infant is upright because this position slightly reduces ICP. The sign may be elicited in a healthy infant younger than age 4 weeks by suddenly changing his head position, and in a healthy infant up to age 9 months by shining a bright light into his eyes and removing it quickly. Identifying Setting Sun Sign With this late sign of increased intracranial pressure in an infant or a young child, pressure on cranial nerves III, IV, and VI forces the eyes downward, revealing a rim of sclera above the irises."

Has the infant experienced a fall or even a minor trauma? When did this sign appear? Ask about early nonspecific signs of increasing ICP: Has the infant’s sucking reflex diminished? Is he irritable, restless, or unusually tired? Does he cry when moved? Is his cry high pitched? Has he vomited recently? Next, perform a physical examination, keeping in mind that neurologic responses are primarily reflexive during early infancy. Assess the infant’s LOC. Is he awake, irritable, or lethargic? Keeping in mind his age and level of development, try to determine his ability to reach for a bright object or turn toward the sound of a music box. Observe his posture for normal flexion and extension or opisthotonos. Examine muscle tone, and observe for seizure automatisms. Examine the infant’s anterior fontanelle for bulging, measure his hea"

Elevate the head of the crib to at least 30 degrees, and monitor intake and output. Monitor ICP, restrict fluids, and insert an I.V. line to administer a diuretic. For severely increased ICP, ET intubation and mechanical hyperventilation may be required to reduce serum carbon dioxide levels and constrict cerebral vessels. Therapy to induce a barbiturate coma or hypothermia therapy may be required to lower the metabolic rate. Try to maintain a calm environment and, when the infant cries, offer comfort to help prevent stress-related ICP elevations.

Other signs and symptoms include a fever, fatigue, weight loss, malaise, and hepatosplenomegaly. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma initially produces erythematous patches with some scaling that later become interspersed with nodules. Pruritus and discomfort are common; later, tumors and ulcers form.

A few days or weeks later, yellow-tan or erythematous patches with scaly edges erupt on the trunk and limbs and sometimes on the face, hands, and feet. Pruritus also occurs. Pityriasis rubra pilaris, an uncommon disorder, initially produces seborrheic scaling on the scalp, progressing to the face and ears.

Skin Turgor, Decreased Skin turgor — the skin’s elasticity — is determined by observing the time required for the skin to return to its normal position after being stretched or pinched. With decreased turgor, pinched skin “holds” for up to 30 seconds and then slowly returns to its normal contour. Skin turgor is commonly assessed over the hand, arm, or sternum — areas normally free from wrinkles and with wide variations in tissue thickness. (See Evaluating Skin Turgor, page 670.) Decreased skin turgor results from dehydration, or volume depletion, which moves interstitial fluid into the vascular bed to maintain circulating blood volume, leading to slackness in the skin’s dermal layer. It’s a normal finding in elderly patients and in people who have lost weight rapidly; it also occurs with disorders affecting the GI, renal, endocrine, and other systems."

Usually, however, it points to infection, trauma, or a hepatic, autoimmune, neoplastic, or hematologic disorder. Because the spleen functions as the body’s largest lymph node, splenomegaly can result from any process that triggers lymphadenopathy. For example, it may reflect reactive hyperplasia (a response to infection or inflammation), proliferation or infiltration of neoplastic cells, extramedullary hemopoiesis, phagocytic cell proliferation, increased blood cell destruction, or vascular congestion associated with portal hypertension.

What Happens in Tachycardia Tachycardia represents the heart’s effort to deliver more oxygen to body tissues by increasing the rate at which blood passes through the vessels. This sign can reflect overstimulation within the sinoatrial node, the atrium, the atrioventricular node, or the ventricles. Because heart rate affects cardiac output (cardiac output = heart rate × stroke volume), tachycardia can lower cardiac output by reducing ventricular filling time and stroke volume (the output of each ventricle at every contraction). As cardiac output plummets, arterial pressure and peripheral perfusion decrease.

Tachypnea A common sign of cardiopulmonary disorders, tachypnea is an abnormally fast respiratory rate — 20 or more breaths/minute. Tachypnea may reflect the need to increase minute volume — the amount of air breathed each minute. Under these circumstances, it may be accompanied by an increase in tidal volume — the volume of air inhaled or exhaled per breath — resulting in hyperventilation. Tachypnea, however, may also reflect stiff lungs or overloaded ventilatory muscles, in which case tidal volume may actually be reduced. Tac"

Tachypnea, however, may also reflect stiff lungs or overloaded ventilatory muscles, in which case tidal volume may actually be reduced. Tachypnea may result from reduced arterial oxygen tension or arterial oxygen content, decreased perfusion, or increased oxygen demand. Heightened oxygen demand, for example, may result from fever, exertion, anxiety, and pain. It may also occur as a compensatory response to metabolic acidosis or may result from pulmonary irritation, stretch receptor stimulation, or a neurologic disorder that upsets medullary respiratory control. Generally, respirations increase by 4 breaths/minute for every 1°F (17.2°C) increase in body temperature. Emergency Interventions After detecting tachypnea, quickly evaluate cardiopulmonary status; obtain a set of vital signs with oxygen saturation; and check for cyanosis, chest pain, dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypotension.

Tachypnea gradually worsens as fluid accumulates in the patient’s lungs, causing them to stiffen. It’s accompanied by accessory muscle use, grunting expirations, suprasternal and intercostal retractions, crackles, and rhonchi. Eventually, ARDS produces hypoxemia, resulting in tachycardia, dyspnea, cyanosis, respiratory failure, and shock. Anaphylactic shock. With anaphylactic shock — a life-threatening type of shock — tachypnea develops within minutes after exposure to an allergen, such as penicillin or insect venom. Accompanying signs and symptoms include anxiety, pounding headache, skin flushing, intense pruritus, and, possibly, diffuse urticaria.

If you detect tachypnea, first rule out the causes listed above. Then consider these pediatric causes: congenital heart defects, meningitis, metabolic acidosis, and cystic fibrosis. Keep in mind, however, that hunger and anxiety may also cause tachypnea. Geriatric Pointers Tachypnea may have a variety of causes in elderly patients — such as pneumonia, heart failure, COPD, anxiety, or failure to take cardiac and respiratory medications appropriately — and mild increases in respiratory rate may be unnoticed.

Tinnitus Tinnitus literally means ringing in the ears, although many other abnormal sounds fall under this term. For example, tinnitus may be described as the sound of escaping air, running water, the inside of a seashell, or as a sizzling, buzzing, or humming noise. Occasionally, it’s described as a roaring or musical sound. This common symptom may be unilateral or bilateral and constant or intermittent. Although the brain may adjust to or suppress constant tinnitus, tinnitus may be so disturbing that some patients contemplate suicide as their only source of relief. Tinnitus can be classified in several ways. Subjective tinnitus is heard only by the patient; objective tinnitus is also heard by the observer who places a stethoscope near the patient’s affected ear. Tinnitus aurium refers to noise that the patient hears in his ears; tinnitus cerebri, to noise that he hears"

Common Causes of Tinnitus Tinnitus usually results from a disorder that affects the external, middle, or inner ear. Below are some of its more common causes and their locations. History and Physical Examination Ask the patient to describe the sound he hears, including its onset, pattern, pitch, location, and intensity. Ask whether it’s accompanied by other symptoms, such as vertigo, headache, or hearing loss. Next, take a health history, including a complete drug history. Using an otoscope, inspect the patient’s ears and examine the tympanic membrane. To check for hearing loss, perform the Weber and Rinne tuning fork tests. (See Differentiating Conductive from Sensorineural Hearing Loss, page 372.) Also, auscultate for bruits in the neck. Then compress the jugular or carotid artery to see if this affects the tinnitus.

With atherosclerosis of the carotid artery, the patient has constant tinnitus that can be stopped by applying pressure over the carotid artery. Auscultation over the upper part of the neck, on the auricle, or near the ear on the affected side may detect a bruit. Palpation may reveal a weak carotid pulse. Cervical spondylosis. With degenerative cervical spondylosis, osteophytic growths may compress the vertebral arteries, resulting in tinnitus. Typically, a stiff neck and pain aggravated by activity accompany tinnitus.

Examination with a pneumatic otoscope reveals movement of the tympanic membrane with respirations. At times, breath sounds can be heard with a stethoscope placed over the auricle. Glomus jugulare (tympanicum tumor). A pulsating sound is usually the first symptom of this tumor.

Tracheal Deviation Normally, the trachea is located at the midline of the neck — except at the bifurcation, where it shifts slightly toward the right. Visible deviation from its normal position signals an underlying condition that can compromise pulmonary function and possibly cause respiratory distress. A hallmark of life- threatening tension pneumothorax, tracheal deviation occurs with disorders that produce mediastinal shift due to asymmetrical thoracic volume or pressure. A nonlesion pneumothorax can produce tracheal deviation to the ipsilateral side. (See Detecting Slight Tracheal Deviation.)

    "text": "Urinary Incontinence Incontinence, the uncontrollable passage of urine, can result from a bladder abnormality, a neurologic disorder, or an alteration in pelvic muscle strength. A common urologic sign, incontinence may be transient or permanent and may involve large volumes of urine or scant dribbling. It can be classified as stress, overflow, urge, or total incontinence. Stress incontinence refers to intermittent leakage resulting from a sudden physical strain, such as a cough, sneeze, laugh, or quick movement. Overflow incontinence is a dribble resulting from urine retention, which fills the bladder and prevents it from contracting with sufficient force to expel a urine stream. Urge incontinence refers to the inability to suppress a sudden urge to urinate. Total incontinence is continuous leakage resulting from the bladder’s inability to retain urine.

Once he’s able to stay dry for 2 hours, increase the time between voidings by 30 minutes each day until he achieves a 3- to 4-hour voiding schedule. When your patient voids, make sure that the sequence of conditioning stimuli is always the same. Make sure that the patient has privacy while voiding — any inhibiting stimuli should be avoided.

But it can also result from infection, a local pelvic disorder, estrogenic stimulation, atrophy of the endometrium, and physiologic thinning and drying of the vaginal mucous membranes. Bleeding from the vagina may be indicative of bleeding from another gynecological location, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, or vagina. Bleeding usually occurs as slight, brown or red spotting developing either spontaneously or following coitus or douching, but it may also occur as oozing of fresh blood or as bright red hemorrhage. Many patients — especially those with a history of heavy menstrual flow — minimize the importance of this bleeding, delaying diagnosis.

It can also occur when fluid retention causes edema. When weight gain results from overeating, emotional factors — most commonly anxiety, guilt, and depression — and social factors may be the primary causes. Among the elderly, weight gain commonly reflects a sustained food intake in the presence of the normal, progressive fall in basal metabolic rate. Among women, a progressive weight gain occurs with pregnancy, whereas a periodic weight gain usually occurs with menstruation. Weight gain, a primary sign of many endocrine disorders, also occurs with conditions that limit activity, especially cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders.

Record the measurement registered on the handle gauge to the nearest 0.5 mm. Take two more readings, and average all three to compensate for any measurement error. To measure the subscapular skin fold, use your thumb and forefinger to grasp the skin just below the angle of the scapula, in line with the natural cleavage of the skin.

Ask him about previous weight and if the recent loss was intentional. Be alert to lifestyle or occupational changes that may be a source of anxiety or depression. For example, has he gotten separated or divorced? Has a family member or friend died recently? Has he recently changed jobs? Inquire about recent changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or bulky, floating stools. Has the patient had nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, which may indicate a GI disorder?

Typically, its onset is sudden and severe; however, its intensity can vary from sharp pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting to a chronic, dull ache.

If a young male complains of abdominal pain, always carefully examine the scrotum because abdominal pain often precedes testicular pain in testicular torsion."

This capability allows healthcare professionals to customize model behavior for specific clinical scenarios, patient populations, or medical specialties by including relevant examples or guidelines in their prompts.

User-Centered and Clinician-Involved Studies Recognizing that successful integration of LLMs in healthcare requires more than technical excellence, recent research has increasingly incorporated feedback from clinicians and end-users. Human-centered evaluation frameworks, such as the QUEST protocol, involve physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in the systematic assessment of LLM outputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, bias, and harm in real clinical scenarios [71]. Large-scale studies have shown that clinicians generally view LLMs as valuable adjuncts: improving diagnostic confidence, supporting decision making, and improving workflow efficiency, especially when the models are positioned as assistive tools rather than autonomous decision makers [72–74].

Data Diversity and Heterogeneity in Healthcare A central challenge in deploying LLMs in healthcare is the heterogeneity of data across languages, demographic groups, healthcare systems, and data quality. Healthcare data are inherently diverse, encompassing structured records, free-text clinical notes, imaging, and patient-generated information, each with unique formats and standards. This diversity is further complicated by regional differences in language, medical terminology, cultural practices, and health system workflows. For instance, an LLM trained predominantly on English-language data from high-resour"

Such disparities hinder the generalizability and equity of AI-driven solutions, risking the exacerbation of existing health disparities [75]. Data heterogeneity also includes demographic diversity, age, sex, ethnicity, and so- cioeconomic status. Models trained on non-representative datasets may perpetuate biases, resulting in less accurate or potentially unsafe recommendations for underrepresented groups [4,75].

Patient privacy represents a fundamental concern, as these models may inadvertently memorize or leak sensitive health information from their training data [6,68]. Ensuring compliance with healthcare privacy regulations such as HIPAA, while leveraging the capabilities of LLMs requires sophisticated data protection measures and appropriate limitations on model inputs and outputs [5,6].

Studies have demonstrated that certain models exhibit racial bias in patient diagnosis, disproportionately affecting minority groups [5]. This algorithmic bias may re- sult from the underrepresentation of certain populations in training data or the presence of biased clinical practices in the historical record from which models learn [4,6].
